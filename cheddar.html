      <h2>Cheddar cheese</h2>
      <p>

       For those living in North America, Cheddar Cheese is usually the first one that comes to mind at the mention of 'cheese.'
       With international recognition, it's considered one of the most popular cheeses consumed. A cheese with huge versatility in taste - from mild and buttery to savoury and sharp - and texture 
       - from rubbery to chrystalline - it can cater to everyone's tastevuds. You can have it mild and aged for only a few months, or if you want a sharper flavour then aged for years. 
       Usually, it's made using cow's milk but can be made us but can be made using goat's milk or buffallow milk

      <h3>Cheese Fact!</h3>
      <p>
        The name cheddar is not protected! Because of this, factories can churn out lower quality cheese and still brand it as cheddar. At the moment, there are
        only six cheesemakers that still make traditional cheddar. All of them are located in the UK!
      </p>

      <p>
        But, while traditional cheddar is can be difficult to obtain, a block of cheddar from the grocery store or local deli will still do its job in craving the cheese addiction!

        <br>Here's a list of recipes that'll fill your plate with much needed cheddar cheese!
        <ul>
          
          <li><a href = "https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/li-l-cheddar-meat-loaves/">Lil Cheddar Meat Loaves</a></li>
          <p>While this receipe features mini meat loaves, I also enjoy making them full size when I want traditional slices to share with the fam!
            <br>The sharpness of the cheese balances out the sweetness of the sauce for an endless craving. If you want more of a surprise, I recommend adding 
            a small chunk of cheese in the middle for a cheesy explosion. However, if you're not a fan of the fat and oil, low-fat cheddar cheese for all the gooeynesss without the oil is a perfect choice.
