      <h2>Mozzarella cheese</h2>
      <p>
        Mozzarella is the cheese of pizzas! Originating in Italy, mozzarella is primarily made of cow’s milk but had once been – and still is to some extent – made using water buffalo milk. Mozzarella has an elastic texture and a mild, sweet taste. While it’s popularly known as the cheese to put on pizza, it can also be eaten fresh!
         In stores, mozzarella meant for pizza or cooking will be sold wrapped in plastic, usually as a block. However, mozzarella meant to be consumed fresh will be sold in containers, usually floating in brine. 
        
      </p>
      <h3>Eating Fresh!</h3>
      <p>
        Because mozzarella is so mild tasting, it’s usually added for texture rather than taste. However, it does an excellent job of absorbing flavours and accentuating the goodness of your dish. So if you want a vehicle to bring your dish to life, 
        and bring mouthful upon mouthful of flavour with every bite, mozzarella is an excellent topping for your dish.
      </p>

      <h3>Mozzarella facts!</h3>
      <p>
        The history of mozzarella is actually connected to the history of the water buffalo!
         In WWII, water buffalo herds were destroyed by Nazi forces, which triggered the switch to using cow milk to create mozzarella.
          However, water buffalo mozzarella is still being made; however, it is heavily regulated.  Water buffalo mozzarellas must fulfill certain criteria, and once fulfilled, 
          the cheese is wrapped and labelled with the name and logo of the company that regulates these cheeses: ‘Mozarella di Bufala Campagna’. 
        The mozzarellas must also contain relevant legal information and an authorization number.
        <br>When made with milk, mozzarella takes a milky, slightly sweet taste. When made with water buffalo milk, it has a mossy, grassy aroma and a slightly tangy taste.
