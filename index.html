      <h3>What is cheese?</h3>
      <p>
        The main ingredient in this is milk. From cow, to sheep, to goat - any animal milk you can think of - cheese can be made from it. 
        After all, in the end, despite the huge range of tastes and texture - salty to sweet, creamy to crumbly - the base of our addiction is one thing: proceessed milk curds. 
        If you're vegan though, don't turn back! This website will cover vegan cheeses as well (though nutrition will differ from non-vegan varieties). But, despite being made from the same base, 
        the magic of this food comes from the people (and the diffrent ingredients and methods they came up with).
        Different cultures came up with different methods of processing milk, and that gave birth to the wide variety that we see in the deli today! 
        There's Cheddar from America, Parmesan from Italy, Gouda from the Netherlands, Halloumi from Cyprus.
        When you eat cheese, you're getting a taste of the different cultures of the globe!

    <h3>Why make a website for beginners</h3>
    <p>
      If you're like me, exposed to the world of fastfood - of pizza and burgers - then your first encounter with cheese was most likely Cheedar and Mozarella. And don't get me wrong, these are great: 
      I can never get a burger without a piece of cheddar slipped between the buns, or a pizza with a sprinkle of extra goodness. But, to narrow your tastebuds to just the two when there's dozens of varieties available
      at your local deli, and hundreds in the world to choose from...really, you're missing out. 

      <br>But. 

      <br>Growing up with just the basics of basics on cheese, to be introduced to others from roommates and friends, I was surprised at just how extensive a world I was missing.
      <br> Halloumi, god, this was a game changer: cheese you could fry and barbecue!
      <br> And, Brie. Man, the day I dipped a cracker in that puddle of stringy, creamy goodness... </p>
      <br> Well, anyways. The point I wanted to get across was that <i>I</i> was a beginner. And this website is my way of imparting knowledge that I learned (and am still learning!) to fellow Newbies.

      <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        With the huge variety of cheese to try, it’s unsurprising that the opinion on it is divided. Yes, it can be high in saturated fats and sodium. (Unhealthy!) 
        But yes, you can choose varieties that are low fat, and low sodium (healthy!).But, despite this division because of fat and sodium content, cheese does contain a good amount of nutrients to our body’s benefit.
